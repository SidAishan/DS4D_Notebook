    "We started working with loops in the Introduction notebook. They are one of the most powerful ideas in programming. Here's Mickey Mouse, one of the worlds first programmers realising that  if you can make a computer (or a broomstick) do something once, it can do it a million times - sometimes with unpredictable results: https://vimeo.com/7878564\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to develop a mindset where if you find yourself doing something more that once, you think \"how can I put this in a loop\" - even if you're just doing it 2 or 3 times, there's a good chance that later on, you'll end up doing it lots of times.\n",
